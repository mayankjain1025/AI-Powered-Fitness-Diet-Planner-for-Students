# AI-Powered Fitness & Diet Planner for Students

A lightweight, student-focused web app that uses AI to create personalized fitness and meal plans based on schedules, preferences, and goals. This repository contains the source code, sample data, and instructions to run and extend the planner.

## Why this project

Students have limited time, tight budgets, and busy schedules. This project provides an approachable tool that suggests realistic workouts and meals optimized for time, cost, and nutrition â€” all personalized with simple AI-driven recommendations.

## Features

- Personalized fitness plans (beginner to advanced)
- Nutrition-aware meal suggestions and sample grocery lists
- Time- and budget-sensitive recommendations for students
- Simple CLI / web interface (see repository for the actual interface)
- Extensible: add new diet preferences, workouts, or AI models

## Tech stack

- Python (core logic)
- Flask/FastAPI or similar for the web interface (see code)
- Optional: a small ML model or API integration for personalization
